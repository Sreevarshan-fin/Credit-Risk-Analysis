## Credit Risk Modelling

---

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on credit risk modeling for an NBFC that serves customers who are often rejected by traditional banks. The existing credit evaluation process is manual, slow, and inconsistent, making it difficult to scale as application volumes increase. Delayed decisions and inconsistent risk assessment increase operational burden and expose the business to higher credit losses.

---

## Problem Approach

A credit risk model is developed to estimate the probability of default for each applicant, with priority given to identifying risky borrowers early. Instead of directly approving or rejecting loans, the model generates risk scores and explainable insights. These insights are converted into business rules and integrated into a Business Rule Engine, enabling automated, consistent, and transparent credit decisions while still allowing human review where needed.

---

## Objective

The objective is to build a reliable credit risk modeling system that improves risk identification, reduces bad loans, and supports faster and more consistent credit decisions without compromising explainability or compliance.

---

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an industry-ready credit risk modeling solution that accurately measures default risk, minimizes financial losses, improves decision turnaround time, and combines machine learning with clear business logic for scalable and auditable lending decisions.
